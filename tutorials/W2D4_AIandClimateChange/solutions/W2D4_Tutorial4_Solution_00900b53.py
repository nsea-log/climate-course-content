1. Yes, there appears to be a decrease in score when the model is tested on new location data.
2. The decrease in score could be attributed to the model's inability to generalize well to new locations.
 It's possible that the model has learned patterns specific to the training data but fails to capture the nuances present in the new location data.
3. If the model was tested on an even farther away region, such as North America,
 we might expect the performance to deteriorate further. This is because the model was trained on data from a different geographical region,
 and it may struggle to accurately predict temperatures in regions with vastly different climate patterns and environmental factors.
