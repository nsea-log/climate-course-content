Discussion:
1. Adjusting the `max_depth` parameter influences the complexity of the decision tree model.
Increasing `max_depth` may lead to a more complex model that can capture intricate patterns in the training data,
potentially resulting in higher predictive accuracy. (However, as we will discuss in the next tutorial, this can also increase the risk of overfitting,
where the model learns noise in the training data instead of true patterns, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.)

2. Visualizing the decision tree at different depths (`dt_vis_depth`) provides insights into the hierarchy of features
and decision-making process within the model. Lower depths reveal high-level splits that capture broader patterns in the data,
while higher depths expose finer details and nuances. By adjusting `dt_vis_depth`,
users can focus on specific branches of the tree, uncovering key decision points and feature interactions.
This exploration helps in understanding how the model makes predictions and identifying influential features in the dataset.

3. By examining the scatter plot, we can identify any consistent patterns or trends in the residuals, indicating potential systematic errors
or biases in the model's predictions. These observations can inform adjustments to the model, such as incorporating additional features
or refining existing ones, to enhance its accuracy. Identifying outliers
or clusters of residuals also highlights areas where the model may struggle to generalize,
suggesting targeted improvements for better performance.
