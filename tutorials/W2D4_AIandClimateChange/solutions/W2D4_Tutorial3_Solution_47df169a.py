1. Observations: Adjusting `n_estimators` and `max_depth` may cause fluctuations in model performance. Increasing `n_estimators` initially improves performance, but too many trees may lead to overfitting. Similarly, increasing `max_depth` initially enhances performance by capturing complex patterns, but excessively deep trees may result in overfitting.

2. Capacity and Overfitting: Capacity refers to a model's ability to capture complex patterns, while overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of true patterns. Increasing capacity, like using more trees or deeper trees, can lead to overfitting.

3. Preventing Overfitting: Apart from adjusting model capacity, we could also consider training on a larger dataset. Machine learning techniques like regularization techniques, cross-validation, feature selection, and ensemble methods help prevent overfitting. These approaches ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data by balancing complexity and performance.
