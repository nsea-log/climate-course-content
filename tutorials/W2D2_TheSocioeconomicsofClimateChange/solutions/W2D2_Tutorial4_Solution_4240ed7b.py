2. We choose 'Emissions' and 'Land Cover|Forest' as variables of interest to contrast ecosystem health between the two scenarios.
First, note that the land model components from the IMAGE and REMIND-MAGPIE estimate different initial land cover areas, if we assume however that their trend is reasonable, we can conclude the following:
For high emissions, forcing rises and hence temperature, we know that precipitation patterns change with higher temperatures such that forests,
here our indicator for ecosystem health, are dying.
In turn the land cover by forests is decreasing in the SSP5 scenario.
In contrast, the SSP1 reduces emissions and also exploits resources like wood only sustainably due to afforestation.
As afforestation is also used to capture carbon, while land use is reduced in general,
the scenario shows an increase in land cover by forests within the current century.
