1. At first, En-ROADS is a world model, not an optimal planning model so it is unlike any IAM used e.g. for the IPCC reports.
Controls are somewhat limited (DAC/CCS, soil, BioChar, and mineralization are not covered).
It allows only for single parameter changes -  in reality, there will be correlations, e.g. between carbon pricing and renewables due to market pressure.
Some feedbacks are also missing, besides the above-mentioned damage from climate change on GDP, land use, etc.,
climate change harms the human population by shortening lives.
Although this happens already in the current 1Â°C increase reality, this harm is difficult to quantify and hence not implemented.
Furthermore, it is a fully aggregated model, no spatial/regional or income resolution, and corresponding interdependency exists.
An action/ policy is assumed to be executed globally, which is a utopia so far.
It hence remains important to consider the implications of heterogeneity across different countries and their interactions.
Last but not least, tipping points such as the thawing of the permafrost are represented in a very simplified manner only, although they probably have strong implications.
