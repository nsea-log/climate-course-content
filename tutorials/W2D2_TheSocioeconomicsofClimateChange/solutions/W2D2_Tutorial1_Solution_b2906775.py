3. One scenario to try based on the goals of the energy transition is the combination of:
(1) full electrification of the energy supply, i.e. 'very highly taxed' fossil fuel emissions (Coal, Natural gas, and Oil),
(2) 'highly subsidized' renewables, and
(3) a 'very high' carbon price,
as well as the 'highly reduced' emissions of Methane and other Gases
which gets us to a maximum increase of 2°C by the end of the century
(cf. this example scenario https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=24.3.0&p1=100&p7=85&p10=5&p16=-0.05&p23=-1&p39=250&p59=-64&p67=2&g0=2&g1=62).

Nevertheless, other scenarios are possible, either by involving more parameters or by focusing on carbon removal.
There are (at least!) two important observations to make. First, actions vary in leverage, in other words, some actions are more helpful than others.
Second, to make a difference and reach an ambitious goal like the 2°C degree target, many actions in many sectors are required.
Sometimes one refers to this circumstance by calling it a 'Silver Buckshot' instead of a 'Silver Bullet' approach (cf. e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2006/05/27/welcome-to-the-climate-crisis-span-classbankheadhow-to-tell-whether-a-candidate-is-serious-about-combating-global-warmingspan/26b2ac5a-a4a3-46ff-b214-3fc07a3a5ab3/).
Furthermore, people might be surprised by the fact that some actions may be much lower leverage, while others like carbon pricing and energy efficiency might be higher leverage than people expect.
