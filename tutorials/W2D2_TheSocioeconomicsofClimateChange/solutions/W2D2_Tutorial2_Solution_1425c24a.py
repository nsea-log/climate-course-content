1. There are two options. We could change one boring parameter and a more exciting one.
The former has a strong impact. By turning off the  'Climate change slows economic growth' button, we make the strong assumption that there is less severe damage as asked because there is NO damage at all.
In other words, we decoupled GDP and temperature increase which results in even more GHG emissions than in the baseline scenario.
To get a more relevant and exciting result, it is better to change the 'Economic damage formulation' instead.

2. The default formulation by 'Burke 2018' serves as the baseline.
In order to have a less severe damage formulation we could have a look at the 'Reduction in GDP vs. Temperature' plot.
However, all other formulations show a more or equal severe damage function than 'Burke 2018' with respect to temperature.
Another view, i.e. the 'Gross World Product' in contrast shows that the 'Howard & Sterner' formulation results in less economic damage,
which might have been covered in the 'Reduction in GDP vs. Temperature' graph as the scale was going up to 5Â°C,
which we do not reach until 2100 in our simple baseline-like scenario.
