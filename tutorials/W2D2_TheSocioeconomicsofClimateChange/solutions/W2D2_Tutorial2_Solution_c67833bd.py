1. In En-ROADS the population growth has a small effect on the temperature increase by 2100. On the left, the global population graph emphasizes the development until 2100, resulting in an expected population of 8.8 billion in the lowest growth case and an expected population of 12.56 billion in the largest growth case, respectively.
The former leads to a 3.2°C increase and the latter to a 3.5°C which is only a $\pm$ 0.2°C change due to population growth.
In contrast, economic growth has a much larger impact: high growth (+30.000 $/person/year in 2100) leads to a temperature increase of 0.4°C by 2100 and low growth (-20.000 $/person/year in 2100) decreases it by 0.3°C, making discussions of overpopulation rather irrelevant as the decisions around family choice are personal decisions and efforts to shift these decisions have many ethical implications.
It is instead raising the question of the necessity to end economic growth or at least to discuss its current coupling to resource exploitation.
Note that lower population growth takes a long time to affect emissions because global population shifts do not occur quickly and instead play out over many decades.

2. All possible combinations of pop.-econ. -- low-low: 2.9°C, low-no: 3.2°C, low-high: 3.6°C, no-no: 3.3°C, no-low: 3.0°C, no-high: 3.7°C, high-low: 3.1°C, high-no: 3.5°C, high-high: 4.0°C.
In terms of an anticipated minimal temperature increase, the best (worst) case is to have a low (high) growth in population and economy. It is better to have a decreasing economy and a growing population than vice versa (increasing economy + shrinking population).
Having high population growth and economic growth add up to a larger temperature increase (+0.7°C) than their individual contribution (high pop. growth +0.2°C, high econ. growth +0.4°C) which indicates that these variables are not fully independent in the En-ROADS model.
